## Introduction to Machine Learning
In this section, you will learn about the fundamental concepts of machine learning including the perceptron, perceptron algorithm, different types of learning (supervised, unsupervised, reinforcement), and various applications of machine learning.

## Python Basics
Here, you will get familiar with Python basics such as variables, data structures (lists, dictionaries) and control structures (if, else, loops). This knowledge is essential for implementing machine learning algorithms in Python.

## NumPy and Pandas Basics
NumPy and Pandas are two essential libraries for data manipulation and analysis in Python. In this section, you'll learn about arrays, matrices, and basic operations in NumPy, as well as data manipulation using Pandas DataFrames.

## Supervised Learning
This section focuses on supervised learning techniques including regression (simple linear regression, multiple linear regression, polynomial regression) and classification (binary classification, multi-class classification).

## Training Linear Regression
Here, you'll delve into the details of training linear regression models. Topics covered include data preprocessing (data visualization, data cleaning, normalization, handling missing data), model building (forward propagation and backpropagation), handling bias and variance, and model evaluation.

## Training Classification Model
Similar to linear regression, this section covers the training of classification models. You'll learn about data preprocessing, model building, handling bias and variance, and various evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Unsupervised Learning
In this section, you'll explore unsupervised learning techniques including clustering (K-means, hierarchical) and dimensionality reduction (PCA).

## Project Project Project
Finally, this section is dedicated to a project where you'll apply the knowledge gained throughout the tutorial to solve a real-world problem.

**Updates:** This repository will be updated regularly after each lecture is completed. The tutorial started in March 2024 and will last for six months within 2024.

Within this repository, you will find folders corresponding to each topic covered every week. Each folder contains questions related to the topic. If you encounter difficulties with any of the questions, you can access the solution code provided to guide you through.
